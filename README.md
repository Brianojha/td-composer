# tagDiv Composer v1.0 BETA

License: GPL V3

Author: tagDiv - Themes for smart people


### What's this?
A GPL pagebuilder plugin for WordPress that uses shortcodes to save and reder the page.

### What's special?
- It's somehow compatible with Visual Composer, meaning that it works with some of the same shortcodes.
- The plugin works side by side with Visual Composer, but 
- GPL license, open to new contribuitors, maintained and suppoerted by us (tagDiv)

### Limitations:
-  We generally recomand that you create the pages with tagDiv Composer, we don't have full support for pages generated with Visual Composer
-  Currently the plugin only works with our themes, we did extensive testing and development on Newspaper but it should also work on Newsmag. We plan to support other themes in the future when the pugin si more stable.
