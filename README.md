## What's this?
A GPL pagebuilder plugin for WordPress that uses shortcodes to save and reder the page.

## What's special?
- It's somehow compatible with Visual Composer, meaning that it works with some of the same shortcodes. Please note that a lot of the settings from shortcodes generated with Visual Composer are not implemented yet
- GPL license, open to new contribuitors, maintained and suppoerted by us (tagDiv)
