How the editor starts:
Here we describe how td-composer starts. That happens when you click the edit with td composer link when you edit a post.
by: Ra

- click on edit with td-composer
- tdcMain.js via tdcMain.init(); starts the app
- the first thing that loads is the tdcAdminIFrameUI.js VIA tdcAdminIFrameUI.init() this script adds the live editor iFrame
to the page and when that iFrame is fully loaded (including images) it starts to initialize the other classes.

[iFrame onload]
- we add the wrappers to all the elements
- tdcIFrameData.init( iframeContents );
- tdcOperationUI.init( iframeContents );
